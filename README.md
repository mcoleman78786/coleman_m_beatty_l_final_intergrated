# Thames River Angler Association Redesign
Created by Mallory Coleman and Lucas Beatty

## Getting Started

This is a project given to us for our second-semester final integrated project for Interactive Media Design at Fanshawe College, Malory has taken the role of the developer and Lucas as the designer for this project. The intent of this project is to take the original anglers.org site and give it a facelift, making it more modern using flexbox and making it have more of a professional look.

## Set up

Using Git you can clone the project to your computer and work on it from there then re-push using the proper branch and leaving a comment so we can review the changes before merging it with the master branch.

## Built with

Sublime Text - to create the html css and Javascript
Photoshop and Illustrator - to create the design and assets for the webpages

## Authors

Malory Coleman - Developer - Wrote HTML and CSS
Lucas Beatty - Designer/Developer - Created the wireframes for the site and the initially designed elements for the site, also went back over the HTML and CSS and made minor fixes

## Version

***0.1 This is the first working build*** there are many **changes yet to come** like, more pages and adding in Javascript and completing the design elements.

## Acknowledgments
